Scroll From Source
=====================

####  Today, there is not a shortcut for "Scroll From Source" in Project Panel. So I write the plugin to set the special shortcut for this function. You can set it by any shortcut

* You can set the special shortcut by yourself to all OS(Window/Linux/Mac)

* Default shortcut is Command+Control+S for Mac.
